The first project involved creating an augmented reality (AR) experience for smart glasses. We worked in teams to design and develop an app that could overlay digital information onto the wearer's view of the real world. It was a complex project that required a lot of coordination and problem-solving, but in the end, we were able to produce a really impressive prototype. We even got to demo it for some industry experts, who were impressed with our work.",
